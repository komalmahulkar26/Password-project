            <p>1.Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or
            Stylus.</p>
             <p> 2.Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close
            to the design as you can </p>
            <p>3.Use a JavaScript framework/library to
            practice templating and/or building using components </p>
           <p>4.Try
            estimating the time it will take for you to build the project.</p>
            <p>5.Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate.</p> 
            <p>6. Project
            estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is important
            for professional developers</p>
